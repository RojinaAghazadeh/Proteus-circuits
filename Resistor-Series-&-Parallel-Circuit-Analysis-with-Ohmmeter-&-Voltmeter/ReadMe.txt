Project Overview
This Proteus simulation project demonstrates how to analyze series and parallel resistor circuits using ohmmeters to measure equivalent resistance. It provides interactive circuits where users can verify theoretical resistance calculations with practical measurements.

Features
Series Circuit Analysis: Measures total resistance of resistors connected in series
Parallel Circuit Analysis: Measures equivalent resistance of parallel resistor networks
Ohmmeter Implementation: Direct resistance measurement across circuit terminals
Circuit Variations: Multiple configurations with different resistor valuess
Interactive Simulation: Modify resistor values and observe changes in equivalent resistance
